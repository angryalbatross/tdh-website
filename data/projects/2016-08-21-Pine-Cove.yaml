description: Burgett Technology Consulting was tasked by Pine Cove Christian Camp to find new locations for future summer camps.  A list of criteria was given to Burgett Technology Consulting, including proximity to current customers, major cities and bodies of water, a good climate, future ability to expand, and favorable taxes.  The search methodology used by Burgett Consulting was based on current camperâ€™s locations first, then nearby bodies of water were located.  Cities within a three to four hour radius of those bodies of water were identified and analyzed based on demographic and economic information.  Each prospective body of water was then sorted based on taxes and building regulations for the counties they resided in, as well as proximity to the cities with the best economic prospects.  Ideal bodies of water were chosen, and cash flow analyses were performed based on founding a family camp at their location.  All of this research was then turned over to Pine Cove with reccomendations for the best potential future location.
